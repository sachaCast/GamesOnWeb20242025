## 🌌 Project Overview

**Lisani & Nisali** is a 3D adventure game built with **TypeScript** and **Babylon.js**. The story follows a protagonist who enters a dream world to confront their fears. At the beginning of the game, players choose between two characters:
- **Lisani** (female)
- **Nisali** (male)

> **Note**: 
> - Currently, the player character is represented as a placeholder sphere, and development is ongoing to implement the full character models.

## 📽️ Gameplay Demo

- **Direct Link**: [Watch Gameplay Video](video.mkv) (Download or play in a compatible player like VLC).

## 🚀 Development Approach

- Initialized a new **Vite** project to structure the game environment.
- Designed 3D models in **Blender**, exported as `.glb` files, and imported using **Babylon.js**.
- Game architecture includes separate classes for:
  - **Character** (player controls and actions)
  - **Game Objects** (interactive elements like cubes and donuts)
  - **Level** (environment, enemies, and boss)
  - **Spider** (enemy AI and combat)
  - **Boss** (final enemy encounter)

## 🕹 Gameplay Features

The game takes place in a 3D environment with a room, stairs, and a path leading to a boss arena. Players must navigate the level, collect objects, and defeat enemies to progress.

### 🎮 Movement Controls

| Key (QWERTY)       | Key (AZERTY)       | Action         |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| `W` / `ArrowUp`    | `Z` / `ArrowUp`    | Move forward   |
| `S` / `ArrowDown`  | `S` / `ArrowDown`  | Move backward  |
| `A` / `ArrowLeft`  | `Q` / `ArrowLeft`  | Move left      |
| `D` / `ArrowRight` | `D` / `ArrowRight` | Move right     |

### 🏃‍♂️ Character Actions

| Key         | Action                                     |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Spacebar`  | Jump (only if not crawling)                |
| `ShiftLeft` | Crawl (reduces height and movement speed)  |
| `C`         | Grab (interact with objects like the cube) |

- **Cube Interaction**: A pushable cube can be grabbed with `C` and moved to unlock a path to the next area.
- **Collectibles**: 5 donuts are scattered across the level. Collecting a donut updates the on-screen UI (e.g., "donuts: 2/5").

## ⚔️ Combat System

- **Attack**: Triggered by **Left Click**, creating a red transparent square around the player to indicate attack range.
- **Collectibles and Enemies**:
  - **Donuts**: 5 collectible donuts are scattered throughout the level. Collecting them updates the on-screen counter (e.g., "donuts: 2/5").
  - **Spiders**: Each spider requires **3 hits** to defeat and crawls toward the player when nearby.
  - **Boss Spider**: A larger enemy at the end of the level requires multiple hits to defeat. Upon defeating the boss, a **"LEVEL FINISHED"** message is displayed, and the level ends.
- **Player Health**: The player has **10 HP**, displayed on-screen. Taking **10 hits** from spiders or the boss causes the player to die, triggering a respawn after a 2-second delay with the level reset.
- **UI Feedback**: The on-screen display shows the player's current HP (e.g., "HP: 8/10") and the number of donuts collected (e.g., "donuts: 2/5").
- **Spider AI**: Spiders activate after passing the cube area, they **crawl toward the player** by default.

> 💡 **Want to disable spider AI?**  
> Simply comment out the line below in `TestLevel.ts`:
```ts
// spider.crawl(mainCharacter);
```
