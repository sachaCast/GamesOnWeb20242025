Project Overview

Lisani & Nisali is a 3D adventure game created using TypeScript and Babylon.js. The game is about a protagonist who travels to the dream world to confront his fears. At the beginning of the game, players can choose between Lisani (female) and Nisali (male).

Development Approach

A new Vite project was initialized to create the game.
3D objects were pre-designed in Blender and then imported into the game using Babylon.js.
We are going to implement a character class to dynamically generate multiple characters instead of manually creating each one.

Gameplay Features

Character movement: The protagonist can walk, jump, crawl and climb on platforms.
Various elevated platforms of different heights demonstrate where the character can jump.
